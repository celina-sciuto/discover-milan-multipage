                <h2>Location and Climate</h2>
                <p>Milan is located in the north-western section of the Po Valley, approximately halfway between the river Po to the south and the foothills of the Alps.

                    Milan's climate is similar to much of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot, humid summers and cold, foggy winters. The Alps and Apennine Mountains form a natural barrier that protects the city from the major circulations coming from northern Europe and the sea. During winter, daily average temperatures can fall below freezing (0 째C [32 째F]) and accumulations of snow can occur: the historic average of Milan's area is 25 centimetres (10 in) in the period between 1961 and 1990, with a record of 90 centimetres (35 in) in January 1985. Summers in Milan are hot and humidity levels are high with peak temperatures reaching above 35 째C (95 째F). Due to the high humidity, urban heat effect and lack of wind, nighttimes often remain muggy during the summer months.
